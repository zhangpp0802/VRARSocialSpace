# CS36 AR/VR Social Studio: Final assignment

This assignment is worth 200 points (Marbles, Pokemon, your Room, and the Hubs field trip were each worth 100).  You will:

* Build an interactive VR scene, with
	* 	a scene combining prospect and refuge, with at least two lights
	*  wearables: automatically-assigned masks/hats/etc or other accessories on the user bodies
	*  a cheeseplate: an interactive object that can be manipulate by all users and serve as a conversation starter
	*  a chat pet: a non-interactive object or event that changes over time to provide a conversation starter, or sets the mood	
* Run a user test of the scene in class on Wednesday June 1 (can participate remotely if necessary), but will be much harder
* Fill out this response form with complete thoughts (ie, a couple of well-written sentences per prompt)

Notes: **Your code will automatically assign costumes for users.** This means you don't get to pick your own outfit, and can't see it! You have to ask others to describe what you are wearing to you. This can also be a conversation starter!

**Your chat pet will be controlled only by time.** We don't need to transmit data about what is happening with the chat pet, because everyone shares the same time (we all watch the same sunset, e.g) This is also how Wordle and Blaseball do "social", by having a shared universe that we all watch and talk about. What is something that would be fun to watch as a group?


Turn in to Canvas:

* **`finalproject_individualresponse_yourname.md`**
* **a screenshot of all your team members** in the scene

Groups are recommended for building your scene, but the markdown is written **individually**. No more than 5 members per team

**You will be using the Paripassu repo (to be released Thursday May 26)** You are welcome and encouraged to reuse any code from previous AFrame exercises.

Yiran: Work on customer object and room
Renzhi: Work on wirebase and setup
 
### What did you make as your wearables?

A little cute hate that looks like a flower.


### What are the refuge and prospect in your scene?

We try to make a fire camp that gathering all flowery look user come in to talk and chat together. All users can also move around and also there are defaulted fake users who already in the scene.

### What costumes/wearables are available in your scene?

Users have different color scheme of their body and hair decoration. The hair decoration's color is also related to their body color so that keep a sort of consistency.

### Describe what your chatpet is and what it changes over time

Our chatpet is the moon on the sky and it keep rotating on the sky. If it is invisible at your angle, you can change your fov (loop up) to see.
 
### Describe what your cheeseplate is and how users can interact with it

The cheeseplate is a camp fire and the users can click on it to make it go bigger. It will also setted back to the default smallest size when it goes the biggest it can get.

# Playtests

### Emails of your playtesters
huiye2023@u.northwestern.edu
andrewliso2022@u.northwestern.edu
ruiyang2022@u.northwestern.edu
 
### What were some of the user reactions during your playtest?

They think it is fun to gather together and at that point since our chatpet is not setted up, they wish it can happen so that they can not only with each other but also get more interaction with the scenes.

### What did you change (or want to change) after the playtest?

We added the chatpet and redesigned a little bit of the customer object.
 
### Describe two other experiences you playtested (and their team names)
 
One other team did a beer place that is really interesting and Yiran really like the aime character. One other team, they did a maze scene and it is also fun to play with.

# Reflections


### Pick two authors/speakers that we have read in the class. Starting with "My name is _ and I care about..." (as an example), write two one-or-two-paragraph reviews of your experience, one from each of their perspectives. What did they see when looking at your project?  Include one quote from each author that supports that opinion.
 
My name is DENNIS BRISSETT and I care about if "people can become personally involved in freewheeling association with others". The interesting part is the fire camp. It really offers the atmosphere of people gathing together at the fire and talking, singing, and else. Also, the fun part would also be how people was represented in this one, it is like a rose and would be fun to see roses in this natural scene.

My name is Kevan Lynch and I care about the way of path in a scene since I value "legibility is crucial in the city setting". By this I mean the city scene should be complete and contain the every element that I need in this scene. Since this is a camp fire scene, the rock and trees added on the atmosphere which make this camp fire scene more making sense. 
 
### Our goal for this class was to create a "good party" in VR. What parts of your scene felt successful in that? 

Everyone can be gathering at the fire and talk about the moon on the sky, the fire streghtness, the tree, and the rocks.

### What still seems to be missing? What topics did we skip in class that you think might have answered that question?
