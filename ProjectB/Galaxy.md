(You can change the camera active in code to see the scene in different setted place and angle)


### What was your starting idea? What did you try to build?

I want to create a scene with four family members having picnic in the galaxy. So I create a spinning earth and picnic mat and several particles. For the four family members, they all have different angle since they are at different place and have different height.

### What mood do you want you guests to feel?

Feeling free and relax since it is in galaxy and we are just small creatures.

### What object has a texture, and what texture does it have?

The earth have a texture. It have the earth image wrap on it and I also change its roughness because one of the camera angle is on the "floating table" and I want it to be more realistic.

### What two lights did you add? What effect did you want those lights to have?

I added an ambient light and a point light so that it have a scene light and the floating table can be lighted up.

### Does this room have any of the properties from Hildebrand? (Prospect and refuge, access to resources, mystery and enticement, peril, complexity and order)

It is an aread for user to refuge from reality when stressed, and it is also mysterical and ordered as the properties of the galaxy itself.

### What is this room missing in order to be a place that you and three friends would want to hang out virtually? Activities? Chat pets? 

To hang out virtually, I wish to have more animated weird particels on the plane which we can interact with.
